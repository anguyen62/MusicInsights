This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 


```{r}
View(survery) #make sure the dataframe exists

Person <- survery[,c(3,4,6,7,8)] #one way to make a dataframe based on an existing one

#change complicated column names to something tidier 
colnames(Person)[colnames(Person)=="What is your pseudonym?"] <- "Pseudonym"
colnames(Person)[colnames(Person)=="Which musical instruments/talents do you play? (Select all that apply)"] <- "Preferred_Instrument" 
colnames(Person)[colnames(Person)=="Academic Year"] <- "Academic_Level"
colnames(Person)[colnames(Person)=="Year you were born (YYYY)"] <- "Year"

#levels(Person$`Academic Year` <- as.factor(Person$`Academic Year`))  #
# [1] "Junior"    "Senior"    "Sophomore"  #output

FavoriteSong <- data.frame(survery$Artist, survery$Song, survery$`Link to song (on Youtube or Vimeo)`) #Create FavoriteSong dataframe with an alternative method

View(FavoriteSong)  #ensure clean compilation

#since the FavoriteSong table has the literal object names (i.e. survey.artist, it's time to tidy those too. Let's try another, possibly simpler method.)
colnames(FavoriteSong)[1] <- "Artist"
colnames(FavoriteSong)[2] <- "Song"
colnames(FavoriteSong)[3] <- "Link"

Ratings <- data.frame(preferences$`What was your pseudonym?`, 'artist_song', 'Rating')  #Create Ratings

#Let's clean that up, too.
colnames(Ratings)[colnames(Ratings)=="preferences..What.was.your.pseudonym.."] <- "Pseudonym"
colnames(Ratings)[2] <- "Song"
colnames(Ratings)[3] <- "Rating"

print(Person)
print(FavoriteSong)
print(Ratings)
```
